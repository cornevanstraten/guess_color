# guess_color
Guess RGB colors with pure Javascript (zero dependencies) 

Simple game for learning RGB colors.

**How it works**

The game displays a randomly generated RGB color code in the top
and 3 (easy) or 6 (hard) colored squares in different colors
The player needs to guess which of the squares matches the RGB color code 

If the player clicks the wrong square, it fades out and the player can try again. 
If the player clicks the correct square, all remaining squares and the header turn into that color
and the word CORRECT is displayed in the top
